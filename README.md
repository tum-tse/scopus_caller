## What is _SCOPUS API_

_SCOPUS API_ allows the users to query its database for all the articles based on a specified keyword(s).  
A user needs to create an account on [SCOPUS](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus) using your university or
personal account and generate the SCOPUS key.  
The API specification can be seen at this [link](https://github.com/ElsevierDev/elsapy). Using this API, It is possible
to **retrieve title**,**authors**, **affiliation**, **DOI**, etc of the scientific articles. Further, depending on the
access level of the article and authorized API, the article's **abstract-text** can also be retrieved.

### Semantic Scholar API

Semantic Scholar also provides an API to retrieve the article's meta-data. It is possible to obtain abstracts by
specifying the DOI of the article. Abstracts for all SCOPUS database articles are not available from Semantic Scholar database.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment to install all packages in and activate the environment:  
   _(Make sure you are in the parrent folder of this project)_

   ```sh
   # crate an environment called venv in this project
   python3 -m venv ~/.scopus-caller
   # activate the environment
   source ~/.scopus-caller/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the package

   ```sh
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ scopus-caller==0.1
   ```

## Obtain the API Key

1. If you haven't created an account on [SCOPUS](https://dev.elsevier.com) yet, got to
   [SCOPUS](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus) and create a private account or one via your university.
2. After being logged in, create a new API key [here](https://dev.elsevier.com/apikey/manage), name the label to your
   likings and leave the website input field empty _(it is not important)_.  
   Carefully read and understand the "API
   SERVICE AGREEMENT" and "Text and Data Mining (TDM) Provisions", before using the API and the retrieved data. These
   will be presented to the user while generating the API.
3. Copy you API key and store it in a text file.

## Usage

Import the library and paste the API key.

```sh
# import the module
import scopus_caller as sc

# paste the api here
api_key = ""
```

**Parameters of function _call_scopus.py_**:

Parameters:

- api_key (str): Your Elsevier API key for authentication.
- keywords (list of str): Keywords to search for in article titles and abstracts.
- year (int, optional): The publication year to filter the articles. Default is 2023.

**Example**:

The following command will search for articles with the search terms `transportation`, `road safety` and `machine learning` published before 2023 (inclusive).

```sh
# Obtain the articles
df = sc.get_titles(api_key, ["transportation", "road safety", "transfer learning"], 2023)

# Obtain the abstracts of the above articles. For abstracts, you need to specify the output of previous step as input and then run the following

df = sc.get_abstracts(df)
```
